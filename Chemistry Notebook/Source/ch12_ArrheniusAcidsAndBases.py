# Acids usually have at least one hydrogen, usually written at the beginning of the formula

# Arrhenius bases
# producec OH- ions in water
# taste bitter or chalky
# feel soapy and slippery
# turn red litmus paper blue
# also known as alkalis
# Bases with OH- ions are named as the hydroxide of the metal in the formula
# NaOH - soap making
# KOH - soap, biodiesel making, electroplating
# NaHCO3 - cleaner, water softener
# NH3 - ammonia, making fertilizer

# 12.2 Bronsted - Lowry Acids and Bases
# acid: proton (H+) Donor
# - formula must contain H
# Base: proton (H+) acceptor
# - must have a lone pair

# the products of a Bronsted - Lowry acid-base reaction are a the conjugate acid of the original base and the conjugate bas of the original acid

# writing conjugate acids and bases
# a conjugate acid - base pair consists of two species that differ only by an H+
# The one with a more hydrogen is the acid
# The acid has a charge +1 more than the base

# 12.4 Strengths of Acids and Bases
# A Strong acid completely ionizes (100%) in aqueous solutions.
# HCL(g) + H2O 

# pH = -log[H+]
